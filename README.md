# 🏦 Bankist App Project

Bankist is a simplified banking application built as part of a JavaScript course project. While it doesn’t aim to replace your real bank anytime soon, it does a solid job of simulating core banking features while showcasing important JavaScript concepts under the hood.

The main goal of this project was hands-on learning — taking provided logic and requirements and completing the application to gain practical experience with timers, dates, numbers, and DOM manipulation.

✨ Features
Once logged in, users gain access to a clean and interactive banking dashboard with the following functionality:

📊 Transaction Movements
View a list of recent money movements (deposits and withdrawals), displayed with dates and formatted values.

💸 Transfer Money
Send money to another user by entering their credentials directly within the app.

🏦 Request a Loan
Apply for a loan, which is approved based on simple internal rules.

❌ Close Account
Permanently close your account by confirming your credentials.

🔄 Sort Transactions
Reorder your transaction history either:
by date (chronological order) or by amount (ascending value).

⏱ Automatic Logout
For security purposes, users are automatically logged out after a certain period of inactivity using a session timer.

🛠 What This Project Focuses On

This project was designed to strengthen understanding of key JavaScript topics, including:
-Timers & intervals (e.g. auto-logout functionality)
-Working with dates and times
-Number formatting and calculations
-Advanced DOM manipulation
-Event handling and UI updates

Rather than building everything from scratch, the role of this project was to complete and enhance an existing structure, focusing on logic, behavior, and real-world application flow.

🚀 Tech Stack
JavaScript (ES6+)
HTML5
CSS3

No frameworks, no libraries — just plain JavaScript doing the heavy lifting.

📚 Learning Outcome
The Bankist App serves as a practical demonstration of how JavaScript can be used to build interactive, state-driven applications. It bridges the gap between theory and practice, offering a realistic look at how core JS concepts come together in a functional project.

This project was created while taking “The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!” by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.
